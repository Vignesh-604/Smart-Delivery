# Smart Delivery Management System

A web-based admin system to manage delivery partners, orders, and assignments using smart/manual allocation logic.
Implemented using Typescript, React, Express, Node and MongoDb for database under the course of 4 days. Even though I had litte experience in Typescript, this project, along with the help of AI tools, has been a learning experience for me. I do believe it can be imrpoved on much further but due to the time constaints I was only able to build so much.

## Backend Logic

### Smart Assignment
- Orders with `status: "pending"`
- Active partners (`status: "active"`, `currentLoad < 3`)
- Shift comparison supports **overnight**
- Area matched by normalizing strings (`Zone 1` vs `Zone1`)
- Load-balanced by choosing partner with least `currentLoad`

###  Metrics Generation
- `successRate = (success / total) * 100`
- Breakdown of failure reasons (`no eligible`, `out of shift`, etc.)

---

## Frontend Pages

### `/dashboard`
- Metrics cards (partners, orders, success rate)
- Smart assignment trigger
- Active orders section
- Recent assignments
- Quick actions

### `/partners`
- Register Partner form
- Partner List (with edit/delete)
- View by area

### `/orders`
- All orders with filters (status, area, recent)
- Order details modal
- Manual assign modal

### `/assignments`
- Assignment metrics
- Assignment history list

---

## Frontend Routing

```ts
// main.tsx
<Route path="/" element={<App />} >
    <Route index element={<Dashboard />} />
    <Route path="/partners/details/:id" element={<PartnerDetails />} />
    <Route path="/partners" element={<PartnerList />} />
    <Route path="/partners/new" element={<PartnerForm />} />
    <Route path="/orders" element={<OrderList />} />
    <Route path="/orders/:id" element={<OrderDetails />} />
    <Route path="/assignments" element={<History />} />

    <Route path="*" element={<Dashboard />} />
</Route>
```

---

## Filtering & Sorting Features

- Filter orders by status or recent
- Assign manually via popup modal (not implemented)
- Toggle statuses (picked/delivered)
- Fetch eligible partners for area at current time
- Backend supports `"recent=true"` filter to get recent orders upto 2 days

---

## Sample Partner (Overnight)

```json
{
  "name": "Sonia Patel",
  "email": "sonia@example.com",
  "phone": "9876543210",
  "areas": ["Zone1", "Zone3"],
  "shift": {
    "start": "22:00",
    "end": "06:00"
  }
}
```

---

## Deployment Notes
- Use `.env` for Mongo URI and VITE_PROXY
- Frontend uses proxy for `/api` calls
- Smart assignment can be scheduled via cron or triggered manually
